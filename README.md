# PolynomiaL-_Regression
## Introduction
This exercise explores polynomial regression, a form of regression analysis where the relationship between the independent variable \( X \) and the dependent variable \( y \) is modeled as an \( n \)th degree polynomial. We will create a synthetic dataset, train models with varying degrees of polynomials, and evaluate their performance on different test sets.

## Task
We want to use polynomial regression to model the relationship between the independent variable \( X \) and the dependent variable \( y \).

## Dataset
We will create a synthetic dataset using the given equation. We will use this dataset to train polynomial regression models with varying degrees of polynomials. 
We will also create different test sets to evaluate the models' performance.

## Objective
We want to find the degree of the polynomial that best fits the relationship between the independent variable \( X \) and the dependent variable \( y \). We will use the mean squared error (MSE) to evaluate the models' performance on different test sets.

## Plan
1. Create a synthetic dataset using the given equation.
2. Split the dataset into training and testing sets.
3. Train polynomial regression models with varying degrees of polynomials.
4. Evaluate the models' performance on different test sets using the mean squared error (MSE).
5. Find the degree of the polynomial that best fits the relationship between the independent variable \( X \) and the dependent variable \( y \).
